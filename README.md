## [Play the Game](http://beardsley-james.github.io/doomball/)

SETUP

The game is played on a 6 x 8 hex grid, 6 columns labeled 1-6 and 8 rows labeled A - H. Rows A - C are deployment side A, and rows F - H are deployment side H. The two players draft their armies as such:

5 level 1 units, no more than 3 of any 1 unit
3 level 2 units, no more than 2 of any 1 unit
1 level 3 unit

The two players toss a coin; the most humanoid race calls a side. 

The winner of the coin toss may choose to play either offense or defense, and the player on defense must place his army first. 

The defensive player may choose which side of the board to deploy on. He may place his units on any legal space in the three rows of his designated deployment area. 

Once the defensive player has completed his deployment, the offensive player must deploy all of his units in the opposite deployment area.

Once all units are deployed, the offensive player chooses one of his units to carry the artifact. Carrying the artifact is neither beneficial nor detrimental. The artifact may be passed to any unit within the firing range of the character in lieu of attacking. If the unit carrying the artifact is destroyed, the artifact is placed in the space occupied by the destroyed carrier. The next unit to enter the space picks up the artifact and is the new carrier. The unit must pick up the artifact; the player may not decline this action.

Following deployment, the first turn occurs. The defending player takes the first turn.

---

PLAYER TURN

Before a player's turn, he removes all hits from his units and all pinning effects that he inflicted on enemy units.

During a turn, a player activates any of his units in any order. 

When activated, a unit may first move a number of spaces up to its movement value. 

A unit may not move through a friendly or enemy unit. 
A unit may choose not to move. 

Following its movement, the unit may make an attack on any enemy unit in range. 

Range measurement follow a path from the attacking unit to the target which may not pass through spaces occupied by friendly or enemy units. The range measurement may go around occupied spaces. 

A unit with range 1 may only attack adjacent enemies. 

Once the attack has been announced, a number of coin flips take place equal to the attack value of the attacking unit. Heads count as hits. 

If the defending unit takes fewer hits than its modified defense value, note the number of hits it received and end the activated units turn. 
If a unit takes a number of hits equal to its defense, it will move one space toward its deployment zone's board edge. 
If the unit is unable to retreat for any reason, due to a movement score of 0 or the board edge or otherwise, it is destroyed.
If a unit takes a number of hits greater than its defensive score, it is destroyed.

Once a player has activated all the units he wishes, the next player may take his turn.

TERRAIN

A space may contain one piece of special terrain. Units moving into terrain immediately trigger the special effect of that terrain.

Forest - A unit that moves through at least one forest tile during its turn reduces its maximum movement range by 1 to a minimum of 1. Units on a forest space get +1 defense. Ranged attacks may not pass through forest spaces, though they may enter them.

River - A unit entering a river space immediately flips an attack. A heads results in the unit taking 1 hit. If the unit is driven to retreat by this damage, they will do so following the rules as if it had occurred in combat. A unit can be destroyed by entering a river tile if no avenue of retreat is available. Passing through multiple river spaces may cause the unit to take cumulative hits.

Hill - A unit on a space containing a hill may fire through friendly units as if they were empty spaces. Being on a hill gives a unit +1 defense against adjacent enemies.

Buildings and Fortications - A unit in a space with buildings or fortifications has +1 defense.

---

END OF GAME

Play continues until all one player's units are destroyed or until the artifact is carried to a board edge. 

Once either of these states occur, the round is over. 

The first player to win two rounds wins.

After the first round, the players switch both board sides and roles. After the second round, the player that lost the second round may choose to either switch board sides or roles with the opposing player.

---

VARIANT

All attacks result in hits. The players take turns moving and attacking with units instead of taking turns moving their entire force.

The board is an eight by eight square. The defending player chooses his army as per the base game. The attacking player may choose seven level one units, four level two units, and one additional unit of his choice. Three of the four center spaces of the board contain artifacts. The goal of the attacking player is to take the artifacts to the board edge, where they are removed from the board. The defending player places his entire force in the center of the board, no fewer than one space away from the board edge. The defending player may not place a unit on one of the artifacts. The attacking player places six markers where he wishes around the board edge after the defending player has placed his forces. The attacking player flips six times at the beginning of each of his turns. For every head, he may place a unit of his choice on one of the markers, unactivated and able to take part in the turn.
